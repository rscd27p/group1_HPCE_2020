The valgring output reports the next error:

==19756== Invalid write of size 4
==19756==    at 0x1086D5: main (case1.c:9)
==19756==  Address 0x522d068 is 0 bytes after a block of size 40 alloc'd

From the source we extract the next lines:

  int *a = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
  for (i = 0; i < 11; i++){
    a[i] = i;
  }

As we can see, the malloc operation is reserving memory to save 10 integer values. However, the for loop will actually iterate 11 times (from o to 10), which means that in the last iteration the program will try to save data to a location that was not reserved by the malloc. This is why we get the error "Invalid write of size 4", which is basically indicating that the last attempt to save an integer (4 bytes) is trying to access memory that was not reserved.
